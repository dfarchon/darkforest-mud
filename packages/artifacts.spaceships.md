# Spaceships System Documentation

## Overview

Spaceships are a special category of artifacts in Dark Forest MUD that represent player-controlled vessels for exploration, combat, and resource management. Unlike regular artifacts, spaceships are primarily crafted rather than discovered, and they provide unique gameplay mechanics for fleet management and strategic positioning.

## Spaceship Types

### Scout (Type 1)

- **Role**: Reconnaissance and exploration
- **Base Stats**: 0 Attack, 0 Defense, 10 Speed, 5 Range
- **Materials**: Windsteel (100) + Aurorium (50)
- **Purpose**: Fast movement and long-range scouting
- **Special Abilities**: Enhanced movement speed and range

### Fighter (Type 2)

- **Role**: Balanced combat vessel
- **Base Stats**: 5 Attack, 5 Defense, 0 Speed, 5 Range
- **Materials**: Pyrosteel (150) + Scrapium (100)
- **Purpose**: Versatile combat operations
- **Special Abilities**: Balanced offensive and defensive capabilities

### Destroyer (Type 3)

- **Role**: Heavy assault vessel
- **Base Stats**: 10 Attack, 10 Defense, 0 Speed, 0 Range
- **Materials**: Blackalloy (200) + Corrupted Crystal (100)
- **Purpose**: Maximum firepower and defense
- **Special Abilities**: Highest attack and defense bonuses

### Carrier (Type 4)

- **Role**: Support and transport vessel
- **Base Stats**: 5 Attack, 15 Defense, 0 Speed, 3 Range
- **Materials**: Living Wood (200) + Cryostone (150)
- **Purpose**: Defensive operations and resource transport
- **Special Abilities**: Highest defense bonus, moderate range

## Spaceship Crafting System

### Foundry Requirements

- **Planet Type**: Foundry (PlanetType.FOUNDRY)
- **Minimum Level**: Level 4 or higher
- **Ownership**: Must own the foundry planet
- **Crafting Limit**: Maximum 3 spaceships per foundry

### Crafting Process

1. **Material Collection**: Gather required materials on the foundry planet
2. **Selection**: Choose spaceship type and biome
3. **Crafting**: Execute crafting transaction
4. **Generation**: Spaceship is created with calculated stats
5. **Storage**: Spaceship is added to the foundry planet

### Crafting Multiplier System

The cost of crafting increases with each spaceship created:

- **1st Craft**: 100% base cost (1.0x multiplier)
- **2nd Craft**: 150% base cost (1.5x multiplier)
- **3rd Craft**: 225% base cost (2.25x multiplier)

## Stat Calculation System

### Rarity Determination

Spaceship rarity is calculated based on foundry planet level:

- **Level 1**: Common (100% multiplier)
- **Level 2-3**: Rare (120% multiplier)
- **Level 4-5**: Epic (150% multiplier)
- **Level 6-7**: Legendary (200% multiplier)
- **Level 8+**: Mythic (300% multiplier)

### Biome Bonuses

Different biomes provide varying bonuses:

- **Ocean/Forest/Grassland** (Biomes 1-3): +1 bonus
- **Tundra/Swamp/Desert** (Biomes 4-6): +2 bonus
- **Ice/Wasteland/Lava** (Biomes 7-9): +4 bonus
- **Corrupted** (Biome 10): +8 bonus

### Final Stat Calculation

```
Final Stat = (Role Bonus + Biome Bonus) Ã— Rarity Multiplier / 100
```

### Role-Specific Bonuses

Each spaceship type has unique role bonuses:

#### Attack Bonuses

- Scout: 0 (no attack bonus)
- Fighter: 5
- Destroyer: 10
- Carrier: 5

#### Defense Bonuses

- Scout: 0 (no defense bonus)
- Fighter: 5
- Destroyer: 10
- Carrier: 15

#### Speed Bonuses

- Scout: 10 (only type with speed bonus)
- Fighter: 0
- Destroyer: 0
- Carrier: 0

#### Range Bonuses

- Scout: 5
- Fighter: 5
- Destroyer: 0 (no range bonus)
- Carrier: 3

## Visual System

### Sprite Rendering

- Each spaceship type has unique sprite sheets
- Biome-based color variations (10 different biomes)
- Rarity-based visual effects:
  - **Rare+**: Shine animation overlay
  - **Legendary**: Color inversion effect
  - **Mythic**: Pixel manipulation with enhanced colors

### Sprite Files

- Scout: `/sprites/Scouts.png`
- Fighter: `/sprites/Fighters.png`
- Destroyer: `/sprites/Destroyers.png`
- Carrier: `/sprites/Cruisers.png`

## Spaceship Management

### Ownership and Control

- Spaceships are owned by the player who crafted them
- Can be controlled by the owner from any planet
- Ownership tracked via NFT system
- Can be transferred between players

### Deployment

- Spaceships can be deployed on any planet
- Only one spaceship can be active per planet
- Deployment requires meeting planet requirements
- Can be recalled and redeployed

### Fleet Composition

- Players can own multiple spaceships
- Different types can be mixed in fleets
- Strategic combinations provide tactical advantages
- Fleet size limited by resource management

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Movement and Exploration

- Scout spaceships excel at long-range exploration
- Speed bonuses reduce travel time
- Range bonuses increase movement distance
- Strategic positioning for resource gathering

### Combat Applications

- Fighter spaceships provide balanced combat capabilities
- Destroyer spaceships offer maximum firepower
- Carrier spaceships provide defensive support
- Fleet composition affects battle outcomes

### Resource Management

- Spaceships consume resources for maintenance
- Different types have different resource requirements
- Efficient fleet management optimizes resource usage
- Strategic deployment maximizes resource gathering

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Integration

- `FoundryCraftingSystem.sol` handles spaceship creation
- MUD component system manages spaceship state
- NFT integration for ownership tracking
- Event system for real-time updates
- **Spaceship Bonus System**: Bonuses applied during movement and combat

### Client-Side Features

- React-based crafting interface
- Real-time stat calculation and preview
- Visual feedback for crafting process
- Inventory management system
- **Dynamic Range Circles**: Visual range indicators update with spaceship bonuses
- **Energy Prediction**: Movement energy calculations include spaceship attack bonuses
- **Planet Stats Display**: Planet card shows modified stats when spaceship is selected

### Data Storage

- Spaceship properties stored in MUD tables
- CraftedSpaceship table: Type, biome, rarity, timestamps
- SpaceshipBonus table: Attack, defense, speed, range bonuses
- FoundryCraftingCount table: Crafting limits and multipliers

### Spaceship Bonus Application

#### Movement System Integration

- **Range Bonuses**: Applied to planet range for movement validation
- **Speed Bonuses**: Applied to travel time calculations
- **Attack Bonuses**: Applied to energy arriving calculations for combat
- **Client-Side Validation**: Energy prediction includes spaceship bonuses
- **Contract-Side Validation**: Range validation uses bonus-enhanced range

#### Visual System Integration

- **Range Circles**: Viewport range indicators dynamically adjust with spaceship range bonuses
- **Planet Stats**: Planet card displays modified speed and range when spaceship is selected
- **Energy Display**: Movement energy predictions show spaceship attack bonuses

## Balance and Strategy

### Resource Economics

- Material costs scale with crafting multiplier
- Strategic planning required for efficient resource use
- Early crafting provides cost advantages
- Late-game crafting offers higher rarity potential

### Tactical Considerations

- Scout-heavy fleets for exploration
- Fighter-balanced fleets for versatility
- Destroyer-focused fleets for combat
- Carrier-supported fleets for defense

### Risk vs Reward

- Higher level foundries produce better spaceships
- Crafting multiplier increases costs over time
- Rarity system provides exponential power scaling
- Strategic timing of crafts optimizes efficiency

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- Spaceship upgrades and modifications
- Fleet formation and coordination
- Spaceship-to-spaceship combat
- Advanced crafting recipes
- Spaceship trading marketplace

### Technical Improvements

- Enhanced visual effects and animations
- Improved UI/UX for fleet management
- Mobile optimization for spaceship controls
- Advanced analytics and fleet tracking
- Integration with guild systems
